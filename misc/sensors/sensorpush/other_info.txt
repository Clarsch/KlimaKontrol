1. **Products that Satisfy Your Requirements**: 

   Yes, there are several products available that can function as gateways or hubs for collecting data from Zigbee 3.0 sensors and transferring that data to your own server. Notably, the **Dusun DSGW-030-1** and **DSGW-030** hubs are designed for Zigbee 3.0 connectivity and support data transmission to cloud servers via MQTT protocol, allowing for custom server integration. The **Digi IX15** is another robust option; it supports Zigbee 3.0 and enables data collection from Zigbee devices, which can then be processed or sent to your own server through its programmable environment. Both options offer great flexibility in managing and using the collected sensor data effectively [MTK7688 Wireless ZigBee 3.0 WiFi MQTT Gateway Hub - Dusun IoT](https://www.dusuniot.com/product/zigbee-gateway/)[DSGW-030 MTK7688 BLE 5/Zigbee 3/Ethernet/Wi-Fi IoT Gateway - Dusun IoT](https://www.dusuniot.com/product/dsgw-030-ble-z-wave-zigbee-wi-fi-gateway-with-usb-dongle/)[Digi IX15 IoT Gateway and Cellular Router](https://www.digi.com/products/embedded-systems/digi-xbee/digi-xbee-gateways/digi-xbee-gateways/digi-ix15-xbee-gateway).

2. **Building Your Own Gateway**: 

   If you prefer a DIY approach, using a Raspberry Pi combined with a Zigbee module, such as the **Digi XBee Zigbee module** or a compatible module like the **CC2531 USB dongle**, is a viable option. The Raspberry Pi can run a lightweight server (e.g., using Python with Flask or Node.js) to receive data from the Zigbee module and send it to your preferred server. You would need to set up the Raspberry Pi with software like **Zigbee2MQTT**, which supports communication with various Zigbee devices and can handle data forwarding to MQTT brokers or HTTP endpoints. This approach gives you maximum customization for data handling and allows you to write specific scripts for processing data as you desire [SONOFF Zigbee Bridge Pro Hub, ZigBee 3.0 Smart Gateway, APP Control and ...](https://www.amazon.com/SONOFF-Gateway-Multi-Device-Management-Compatible/dp/B09ZQQZSQZ)[Custom Smart Zigbee Gateway Development Guide (Part-1): Microcontroller ...](https://www.dusuniot.com/blog/zigbee-gateway-development-microcontroller-os-antenna/).
